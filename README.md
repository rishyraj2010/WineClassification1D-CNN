# WineClassification1D-CNN
In the class of alcoholic drinks, no other beverage comes close to the history of wine. From ancient civilizations to modern societies, wine has been perfected  in quality by sommeliers over centuries. Thus, the quality of Wine has been the core focus of the industry. Various ML models have been proposed to predict the quality of the Wine such as Random Forest, MLP,  KNN, SVM etc. These methods are well optimized to predict unbalanced data. However, considering the chemical properties of Wine a new model has been demonstrated. This model considers the interrelationship between features i.e  correlation between residual sugar and density , free sulfur dioxide and total sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide and density, etc. The correlation is obtained with Pearson correlation analysis, 1D-CNN is performed to capture the normalized values of this data. A three- layer ANN is incorporated to find the categorial value of Quality(1-10). This model shows the effectiveness of 1D-CNN over other ML techniques. Accuracy of this model is more than the closest Random Forest Classifier for the given dataset.
